  "review": "## Summary\nThe paper \"SWE-Search: Enhancing Software Agents with Monte Carlo Tree Search and Iterative Refinement\" presents a novel multi-agent framework designed to improve the performance of software agents in complex and dynamic environments. The framework integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a self-improvement mechanism, allowing agents to iteratively refine their strategies through both quantitative numerical evaluations and qualitative natural language assessments. The authors demonstrate a 23% relative improvement in performance on the SWE-bench benchmark compared to standard open-source agents without MCTS, highlighting the potential of self-evaluation driven search techniques in software engineering.\n\n## Strengths\n- **Innovative Integration**: The paper effectively combines MCTS with a hybrid value function leveraging LLMs, which is a novel approach in the context of software engineering.\n- **Performance Improvement**: Demonstrates significant performance gains on the SWE-bench benchmark, showcasing the practical utility of the proposed framework.\n- **Comprehensive Framework**: The inclusion of multiple agents (SWE-Agent, Value Agent, Discriminator Agent) provides a robust system for adaptive exploration, iterative learning, and collaborative decision-making.\n- **Scalability Insights**: Provides analysis on how performance scales with increased inference-time compute, offering insights into system scalability without larger models or additional data.\n\n## Weaknesses\n- **Complexity and Overhead**: The multi-agent system adds complexity and computational overhead, which might limit its applicability in resource-constrained environments.\n- **Limited Benchmarking**: The evaluation is limited to the SWE-bench benchmark. Additional benchmarks could provide a more comprehensive assessment of the framework's effectiveness.\n- **Qualitative Evaluation**: While the paper mentions qualitative feedback, it lacks a detailed evaluation of how this feedback impacts the decision-making process compared to purely quantitative methods.\n\n## Detailed Comments\n- **Introduction**: Clearly outlines the challenges in current LLM-based software agents and the motivation for SWE-Search. Consider expanding on the limitations of existing methods to provide more context.\n- **Methodology**: The description of the SWE-Search framework is detailed, but the explanation of the Value Agent's role could be expanded to better illustrate how qualitative assessments are integrated into the decision-making process.\n- **Evaluation**: The results on SWE-bench are promising, but additional experiments on diverse datasets would strengthen the paper's claims. Consider providing more detailed analysis on the computational cost associated with the framework.\n- **Related Work**: The paper provides a solid overview of related work but could benefit from a more detailed comparison with similar multi-agent systems in software engineering.\n\n## Questions for Authors\n1. How does the computational overhead of SWE-Search compare to existing methods, and what are the implications for real-time applications?\n2. Can you provide more details on how qualitative feedback from the Value Agent is utilized in the decision-making process?\n3. Are there specific types of software engineering tasks where SWE-Search performs particularly well or poorly?\n\n## Missing References\n- Consider citing \"Agent-Driven Automatic Software Improvement\" by Fernando Vallecillos Ruiz for additional context on agent-based approaches in software maintenance.\n- \"Human-In-The-Loop Software Development Agents: Challenges and Future Directions\" could provide insights into the integration of human feedback in agent-driven systems.\n\n## Minor Issues\n- **Grammar**: Ensure consistent use of terminology (e.g., \"Monte Carlo Tree Search\" vs. \"MCTS\").\n- **Clarity**: Some sections, particularly the methodology, could benefit from additional diagrams to illustrate complex concepts.\n- **Formatting**: Ensure all figures and tables are clearly labeled and referenced in the text.\n\n## Recommendation\nOverall, the paper presents a promising approach to enhancing software agents with MCTS and iterative refinement. While the framework's complexity and computational demands are potential drawbacks, the demonstrated performance improvements and innovative integration of qualitative feedback are significant contributions. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the detailed comments and questions raised.",

In response to this challenge, this doctoral research proposal aims to explore innovative solutions by focusing on the deployment of agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform software maintenance tasks. The iterative nature of agents, which allows for continuous learning and adaptation, can help surpass common challenges in code generation. One distinct challenge is the last-mile problems, errors at the final stage of producing functionally and contextually relevant code. Furthermore, this project aims to surpass the inherent limitations of current LLMs in source code through a collaborative framework where agents can correct and learn from each other's errors. We aim to use the iterative feedback in these systems to further fine-tune the LLMs underlying the agents, becoming better aligned to the task of automated so",

The paper proposes an innovative approach to enhance code quality and reliability by leveraging agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate software maintenance tasks. The primary contribution of this research is the development of a framework that utilizes the iterative nature of agents, enabling continuous learning and adaptation to overcome common challenges in code generation, particularly the last-mile problems associated with producing functionally and contextually relevant code.\n\nA key focus of the research is on iterative feedback mechanisms, which are integral to the proposed framework. These mechanisms allow agents to continuously refine their outputs by learning from previous iterations, thereby improving the quality of the generated code over time. This approach is particularly relevant to the paper being reviewed, \"SWE-SEARCH: ENHANCING SOFTWARE AGENTS WITH MONTE CARLO TREE SEARCH AND ITERATIVE REFINEMENT,\" as both papers emphasize the importance of iterative refinement in enhancing the performance of software agents.\n\nThe research also introduces a collaborative agent framework, where multiple agents work together to address the inherent limitations of current LLMs in source code generation. By allowing agents to correct and learn from each other's errors, the framework fosters a collaborative environment that enhances the overall effectiveness of the software maintenance process. This aspect of collaboration is crucial, as it aligns with the iterative refinement strategies discussed in \"SWE-SEARCH,\" highlighting the potential for agents to improve their performance through collective learning and adaptation.\n\nMethodologically, the research employs a combination of LLMs and agent-based systems to automate software maintenance tasks. The agents are designed to iteratively refine their outputs based on feedback, enabling them to adapt to the specific requirements of the task at hand. The research also explores the use of fine-tuning techniques to align the LLMs more closely with the task of automated software maintenance, thereby enhancing their ability to generate high-quality code.\n\nThe key results of the research demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software maintenance tasks. By leveraging iterative feedback mechanisms and collaborative agent frameworks, the research paves the way for more reliable and cost-effective software maintenance solutions.\n\nIn summary, the \"Agent-Driven Automatic Software Improvement\" paper makes significant contributions to the field of automated software maintenance by introducing a novel framework that leverages iterative feedback and collaboration among agents. These contributions are particularly relevant to the paper \"SWE-SEARCH,\" as both explore the use of iterative refinement to enhance the capabilities of software agents. The research highlights the potential for LLM-powered agents to revolutionize software maintenance, offering a promising solution to one of the most costly aspects of software development.",

      "abstract": "In many problem settings, most notably in game playing, an agent receives a possibly delayed reward for its actions. Often, those rewards are handcrafted and not naturally given. Even simple terminal-only rewards, like winning equals 1 and losing equals -1, can not be seen as an unbiased statement, since these values are chosen arbitrarily, and the behavior of the learner may change with different encodings, such as setting the value of a loss to -0:5, which is often done in practice to encourage learning. It is hard to argue about good rewards and the performance of an agent often depends on the design of the reward signal. In particular, in domains where states by nature only have an ordinal ranking and where meaningful distance information between game state values are not available, a numerical reward signal is necessarily biased.

However, the overwhelming majority of existing code models share a major weakness - they are exclusively trained on the syntactic facet of software, significantly lowering their trustworthiness in tasks dependent on software semantics. To address this problem, a new class of \"Morescient\" GAI is needed that is \"aware\" of (i.e., trained on) both the semantic and static facets of software.

Kinetic equations model transport and collision of particles in a position-velocity phase-space. With a diffusive scaling, the kinetic equation converges to an advection-diffusion equation in the limit of zero mean free path. Classical particle-based techniques suffer from a strict time-step restriction to maintain stability in this limit. Asymptotic-preserving schemes provide a solution to this time step restriction, but introduce a first-order error in the time step size. We demonstrate how the multilevel Monte Carlo method can be used as a bias reduction technique to perform accurate simulations in the diffusive regime, while leveraging the reduced simulation cost given by the asymptotic-preserving scheme. We describe how to achieve the necessary correlation between simulation paths at different levels and demonstrate the potential of the approach via numerical experim",
