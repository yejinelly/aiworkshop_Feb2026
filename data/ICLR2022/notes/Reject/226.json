    "abstract": "The movement of data between processes and memory,  not arithmetic operations, dominate the energy costs of deep learning inference calculations.  This work focuses on reducing these data movement costs by reducing the number of unique weights in a network. The thinking goes that if the number of unique weights is kept small enough, then the entire network can be distributed and stored on processing elements (PEs) within accelerator designs,  and the data movement costs for weight reads substantially reduced.  To this end, we investigate the merits of a method, which we call Weight Fixing Networks (WFN). We design the approach to realise four model outcome objectives: i) very few unique weights, ii) low-entropy weight encodings,  iii) unique weight values which are amenable to energy-saving versions of hardware multiplication, and iv)  lossless task-performance.  Some of these goals are conflicting. To best balance these conflicts, we combine a few novel (and some well-trodden) tricks; a novel regularisation term, (i, ii) a view of clustering cost as relative distance change (i, ii, iv), and a focus on whole-network re-use of weights (i, iii).  Our Imagenet experiments demonstrate lossless compression using 56x fewer unique weights and a 1.9x  lower weight-space entropy than SOTA quantisation approaches.  ",

          "summary_of_the_paper": "A technique is developed to reduce the number of unique weights used in a network. The ultimate goal is to exploit this to reduce data movement in hardware. The unique weights are discovered multiple stages of training and clustering. An additional goal is to produce compressible weights. Results demonstrate that good compression ratios are possible, comparable to SoA quantization techniques, but with far fewer numbers of unique parameters. \n\n",
          "main_review": "The work is interesting and appears to achieve its goals. Nevertheless, the impact of the work is currently difficult to assess. \n\nA comparison is made between: \n\na) A scheme that minimises the number of unique weights a network uses:\n    - enabling these to be stored locally in each PE\n    - the weights are shared across all layers of the network \n      (and require no layerwise scaling)\n    - weights are then stored as indexes into this (limited) set of weight values \n\nb) Quantizing and storing narrow weights:\n     - Quantization is performed and the weight values are stored, e.g. as 3-bit values\n     - To support such a scheme additional quantization parameters must be stored\n       on a per layer/filter basis and as such increases the number of unique parameters\n       in the network.\n\nThe argument is made that the approach presented would reduce data movement. What is a realistic expectation here? If we look at the \"No BN-FL\" param counts it would suggest we would require 81-162 parameters vs. 274. Compared to data movement in general, updating a small numbers of parameters within a PE's memory would seem insignificant? Could a stronger argument be made regarding the reductions in data movement that might result from this work? Infrequent data movements, between periods of significant computation, are of less concern perhaps? \n\nAn explanation of precisely what values need to be stored (and how the unique parameter counts are generated) would also make the paper easier to read. \n\nIn the case of WFN, how are weights stored precisely? i.e. to determine the model size. \n\nAre the weights in your scheme compressible with a simple scheme (i.e. suitable to be placed on-chip in each PE) in a way that would further reduce data movement? Again, perhaps the potential gains in the reduction of data movement on-chip could be made clearer?\n",

The clustering stage carefully choses the closest fixed centers for some of the weights. A method is given to produce and increasingly larger set of cluster centers given some boundary conditions. Further representational reduction is realized by using power of two approximations, which lend themselves to very efficient multiplication by shifting. After each clustering stage, a retraining is performed in order to maintain good performance. \n\nExperimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets shows the compression power of WFN.

Overall the authors find some distinct advantages in their approach:\nThey emphasise a low entropy encoding with a regularisation term, achieving entropies smaller than even those seen using 3-bit quantisation approaches. They require no additional layerwise scaling; the unique weights are shared across all layers. They substantially reduces the number of unique parameters in a network when compared to existing SOTA quantisation approaches.\n",
          "main_review": "The paper is well-written (with some minor grammatical errors at some places) and the results shown by the author are comprehensive. \nOne major weakness I found in the paper is that the analysis is not exactly correct. The authors have shown all experiemntal benefits with parameter counts. But reduction in parameters does not necessarily mean energy efficiency. There is a lot of communication related latency costs that add to energy. The type of router/NoC, their data width etc. play a role in characterizing this. Also, just reducing parameters or unique weights does not mean you will have to access the memory less. Depending upon the PE array size, FIFO width etc. , your data access costs may vary.\n\n\nMinor comments for the authors are:\n1) Is their approach only advantageous for accelerators where weights have to be moved from main memory to PEs? Can the authors comment on how their approach is amenable to many emerging accelerators with weight stationary like flow [1, 2], such as compute-in memory or crossbar based where all weights are already programmed in the hardware? [2] talks about a compute in memory architecture for quantized neural networks which is relevant to the author's proposition. \n[1]Shafiee, Ali, et al. \"ISAAC: A convolutional neural network accelerator with in-situ analog arithmetic in crossbars.\" ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News 44.3 (2016): 14-26.\n[2] Vasquez, Karina, et al. \"Activation Density based Mixed-Precision Quantization for Energy Efficient Neural Networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.04354 (2021).\n2) The authors have shown that their work performs better than many clip and scale quantization works. Can the authors comment if their work has any resemblance to pruning methods? For e.g. if we start with a pruning at initialization based network and then try to perform the WFN technique), will it have any repurcussions in the clustering and encoding of unique weights.\n3) Further, there has been recent works [3, 4] that have tied adversarial attacks with weight sharing/quantization together. Can the authors comment on impliction of WFN and how introducing more unique weights can impact adversarial robustness?\n[3]Lin, Ji, Chuang Gan, and Song Han. \"Defensive quantization: When efficiency meets robustness.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.08444 (2019).\n[4]Panda, Priyadarshini. \"QUANOS: adversarial noise sensitivity driven hybrid quantization of neural networks.\" Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design. 2020.\n\n",
          "summary_of_the_review": "I think the authors have come up with a very interesting technique of methods and are targeting a novel issue of data storage for efficient implementation of neural networks. This paper falls under the same category as pruning or quantization, but provides a very fresh perspective. However, their metrics of evaluation using parameter reduction is weak and does not really support the energy efficiency claim that the authors make.

          "comment": "This paper introduces a method to reduce the number of unique weights in a network. The motivation is that this reduces energy consumption, and can lead to speed-ups.\nThe reviewers agree that the paper is generally well-written. They also agree that the method presented is interesting and useful to reduce the number of unique weights of the network.\nHowever, reviewers challenge the authors claim that fewer unique weights necessarily lead to lower energy consumption. Operations involved with this method may even lead to more memory transfers. The experimental section supports well the claim that the number of unique weights is decreased at very little cost in terms of accuracy, but does not provide much data in terms of actual energy consumption.\nGenerally, the reviewers agree that the fundamental idea of this paper is good and should be presented, but since this paper motivation is entirely focused on energy consumption, I suggest that the authors revise the paper and submit it in a future venue. I can see two possible ways to revise the paper: 1) Add actual energy consumption data to the experimental section; or 2) change the motivation of the paper to solely focus on reducing the number of unique weights. It may be useful for some niche applications, or as a starting point for future works."

The unique weights are discovered multiple stages of training and clustering. An additional goal is to produce compressible weights. Results demonstrate that good compression ratios are possible, comparable to SoA quantization techniques, but with far fewer numbers of unique parameters. \n\n",
          "main_review": "The work is interesting and appears to achieve its goals. Nevertheless, the impact of the work is currently difficult to assess. \n\nA comparison is made between: \n\na) A scheme that minimises the number of unique weights a network uses:\n    - enabling these to be stored locally in each PE\n    - the weights are shared across all layers of the network \n      (and require no layerwise scaling)\n    - weights are then stored as indexes into this (limited) set of weight values \n\nb) Quantizing and storing narrow weights:\n     - Quantization is performed and the weight values are stored, e.g. as 3-bit values\n     - To support such a scheme additional quantization parameters must be stored\n       on a per layer/filter basis and as such increases the number of unique parameters\n       in the network.\n\nThe argument is made that the approach presented would reduce data movement. What is a realistic expectation here? If we look at the \"No BN-FL\" param counts it would suggest we would require 81-162 parameters vs. 274. Compared to data movement in general, updating a small numbers of parameters within a PE's memory would seem insignificant? Could a stronger argument be made regarding the reductions in data movement that might result from this work? Infrequent data movements, between periods of significant computation, are of less concern perhaps? \n\nAn explanation of precisely what values need to be stored (and how the unique parameter counts are generated) would also make the paper easier to read. \n\nIn the case of WFN, how are weights stored precisely? i.e. to determine the model size. \n\nAre the weights in your scheme compressible with a simple scheme (i.e. suitable to be placed on-chip in each PE) in a way that would further reduce data movement? Again, perhaps the potential gains in the reduction of data movement on-chip could be made clearer?\n",

The clustering stage carefully choses the closest fixed centers for some of the weights. A method is given to produce and increasingly larger set of cluster centers given some boundary conditions. Further representational reduction is realized by using power of two approximations, which lend themselves to very efficient multiplication by shifting. After each clustering stage, a retraining is performed in order to maintain good performance. \n\nExperimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets shows the compression power of WFN. WFN networks have very few unique weights, and the weight distribution is a small handful of powers-of-two values, while the other unique weights are of low frequency and added only in the final fixing iterations.\n",

Overall the authors find some distinct advantages in their approach:\nThey emphasise a low entropy encoding with a regularisation term, achieving entropies smaller than even those seen using 3-bit quantisation approaches. They require no additional layerwise scaling; the unique weights are shared across all layers. They substantially reduces the number of unique parameters in a network when compared to existing SOTA quantisation approaches.\n",
          "main_review": "The paper is well-written (with some minor grammatical errors at some places) and the results shown by the author are comprehensive. \nOne major weakness I found in the paper is that the analysis is not exactly correct. The authors have shown all experiemntal benefits with parameter counts. But reduction in parameters does not necessarily mean energy efficiency. There is a lot of communication related latency costs that add to energy. The type of router/NoC, their data width etc. play a role in characterizing this. Also, just reducing parameters or unique weights does not mean you will have to access the memory less. Depending upon the PE array size, FIFO width etc. , your data access costs may vary.\n\n\nMinor comments for the authors are:\n1) Is their approach only advantageous for accelerators where weights have to be moved from main memory to PEs? Can the authors comment on how their approach is amenable to many emerging accelerators with weight stationary like flow [1, 2], such as compute-in memory or crossbar based where all weights are already programmed in the hardware? [2] talks about a compute in memory architecture for quantized neural networks which is relevant to the author's proposition. \n[1]Shafiee, Ali, et al. \"ISAAC: A convolutional neural network accelerator with in-situ analog arithmetic in crossbars.\" ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News 44.3 (2016): 14-26.\n[2] Vasquez, Karina, et al. \"Activation Density based Mixed-Precision Quantization for Energy Efficient Neural Networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.04354 (2021).\n2) The authors have shown that their work performs better than many clip and scale quantization works. Can the authors comment if their work has any resemblance to pruning methods? For e.g. if we start with a pruning at initialization based network and then try to perform the WFN technique), will it have any repurcussions in the clustering and encoding of unique weights.\n3) Further, there has been recent works [3, 4] that have tied adversarial attacks with weight sharing/quantization together. Can the authors comment on impliction of WFN and how introducing more unique weights can impact adversarial robustness?\n[3]Lin, Ji, Chuang Gan, and Song Han. \"Defensive quantization: When efficiency meets robustness.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.08444 (2019).\n[4]Panda, Priyadarshini. \"QUANOS: adversarial noise sensitivity driven hybrid quantization of neural networks.\" Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design. 2020.\n\n",
          "summary_of_the_review": "I think the authors have come up with a very interesting technique of methods and are targeting a novel issue of data storage for efficient implementation of neural networks. This paper falls under the same category as pruning or quantization, but provides a very fresh perspective. However, their metrics of evaluation using parameter reduction is weak and does not really support the energy efficiency claim that the authors make.

          "comment": "This paper introduces a method to reduce the number of unique weights in a network. The motivation is that this reduces energy consumption, and can lead to speed-ups.\nThe reviewers agree that the paper is generally well-written. They also agree that the method presented is interesting and useful to reduce the number of unique weights of the network.\nHowever, reviewers challenge the authors claim that fewer unique weights necessarily lead to lower energy consumption. Operations involved with this method may even lead to more memory transfers. The experimental section supports well the claim that the number of unique weights is decreased at very little cost in terms of accuracy, but does not provide much data in terms of actual energy consumption.\nGenerally, the reviewers agree that the fundamental idea of this paper is good and should be presented, but since this paper motivation is entirely focused on energy consumption, I suggest that the authors revise the paper and submit it in a future venue. I can see two possible ways to revise the paper: 1) Add actual energy consumption data to the experimental section; or 2) change the motivation of the paper to solely focus on reducing the number of unique weights. It may be useful for some niche applications, or as a starting point for future works."
