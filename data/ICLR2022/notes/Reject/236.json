    "abstract": "Attention mechanism of late has been quite popular in the computer vision community. A lot of work has been done to improve the performance of the network,\nalthough almost always it results in increased computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a new attention module that not only achieves the best performance\nbut also has lesser parameters compared to most existing models. Our attention\nmodule can easily be integrated with other convolutional neural networks because\nof its lightweight nature. The proposed network named Dual Multi Scale Attention\nNetwork (DMSANet) is comprised of two parts: the first part is used to extract\nfeatures at various scales and aggregate them, the second part uses spatial and\nchannel attention modules in parallel to adaptively integrate local features with\ntheir global dependencies. We benchmark our network performance for Image\nClassification on ImageNet dataset, Object Detection and Instance Segmentation\nboth on MS COCO dataset.",

Based on this module, the so-called Dual Multi Scale Attention Network is proposed. Several experiments are conducted to verify the performance on image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. Results shows that the proposed network has some advantages than previous works.",
          "main_review": "Strengths: \n\nMost of the proposed techniques are based on previous works, thus it is easy to follow. Three kinds of experimental verifications are provided, including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. Better results are achieved on typical benchmarks.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Limited technical contributions \nIn fact, the proposed module largely borrows ideas from existing works, such as SENet, ResNet, shuffle attention, (Fu et al., 2019),  (Li et al., 2019) and (Zhang and Yang, 2021). I think this work is a combination of previous works. Most of the proposed modules have already been used in previous attention methods. The authors also admit these facts. Overall, I think this work is very limited in its novelty.\n\n2. Insufficient evaluations\nIn this work, DMSA consists of many sub-modules. The authors list the ablations in Tab.8. However, there are no visual comparisons. Why the sub-modules are worked? How about their effects on typical image examples? In facts, the authors do not provide any visual examples to clarify the effects of the proposed attention module. Besides, there are no examples on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation. The performance improvements are very small when compared with other attention modules.",

The proposed method is a simple combination of previous methods, and basically, no substantial new technique is introduced.\n\n**(Unconvincing) Experiments**\n* The experimental results are too good to be true. While the idea is simple and has been explored by many related works, authors still achieve unbelievable improvements over all these vision tasks. \n* Also, the baseline is significantly lower than the original results: the image classification result of ResNet101 only achieves 76.83% in this paper, while the standard number should be around 77.37% (see torchvision models: https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html)\n* The results in Table 8 are confusing.  Why does removing FC result in larger GFLOPs? \n* Could authors also report the training/inference efficiency? I assume it would be super slow.\n\n**Presentation**\n* The writing is rather poor, as well as the presentation.

The proposed method is a simple combination of previous methods, and basically, no substantial new technique is introduced.\n\n**(Unconvincing) Experiments**\n* The experimental results are too good to be true. While the idea is simple and has been explored by many related works, authors still achieve unbelievable improvements over all these vision tasks. \n* Also, the baseline is significantly lower than the original results: the image classification result of ResNet101 only achieves 76.83% in this paper, while the standard number should be around 77.37% (see torchvision models: https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html)\n* The results in Table 8 are confusing.  Why does removing FC result in larger GFLOPs? \n* Could authors also report the training/inference efficiency? I assume it would be super slow.\n\n**Presentation**\n* The writing is rather poor, as well as the presentation. Too many typos. \"combined both these mechanism\", \"respectivly\", \"The channel-wise attention weight of the multi-scale feature maps are extracted ...\", \"comparision\", etc. These simple mistakes show this paper is far from well-prepared.",

To achieve a better feature representational ability, authors consider the multi-scale mechanism from both channel-dimension and spatial-dimension. The proposed method has been verified on several benchmarks, including ImageNet and MS COCO. However, all reviewers consider rejecting this paper because this work lacks novelty, the results are suspicious, and the writing is poor. No responses are submitted by authors to address the reviewers' concerns."
