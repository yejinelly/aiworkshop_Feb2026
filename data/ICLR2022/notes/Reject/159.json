    "abstract": "Attention mechanisms take an expectation of a data representation with respect to probability weights. This creates summary statistics that focus on important features. Recently, Martins et al. (2020, 2021) proposed continuous attention mechanisms, focusing on unimodal attention densities from the exponential and deformed exponential families: the latter has sparse support. Farinhas et al. (2021) extended this to use Gaussian mixture attention densities, which are a flexible class with dense support. In this paper, we extend this to two general flexible classes: kernel exponential families and our new sparse counterpart kernel deformed exponential families. Theoretically, we show new existence results for both kernel exponential and deformed exponential families, and that the deformed case has similar approximation capabilities to kernel exponential families. Experiments show that kernel deformed exponential families can attend to non-overlapping intervals of time.",

          "summary_of_the_paper": "The manuscript considers an extension of the attention mechanism framework developed by others in recent work (by Martins et al.). Specifically this framework allows to break free from the discrete nature of attention that typically consists of a weighted average of a finite set of vectors. This is realized by estimating a probability mass function (PMF) over the finite collection of vectors, and then computing the expected value. The generalization allows one to extend the finite collection to a continuum. This is then handled by using a probability distribution function (pdf) over the collection to compute an expected value. In recent work, various authors considered the probability distribution used in defining the attention mechanism to belong to either a unimodal exponential family, a \"deformed\" exponential family (deformed versions having possibly finite support), or a mixture of Gaussians. Traditional exponential family comprises pdfs that possess a finite set of sufficient statistics. In contrast, the kernel exponential family comprises pdfs that have essentially infinitely many sufficient statistics through the use of a kernel. The current manuscript proposes to employ a kernel exponential family, and a deformed kernel exponential family. This allows them to work with multimodal probability distributions, and/or distributions with compact support. The authors layout conditions under which the kernel versions of the (deformed) exponential family are defined. They also apply the new attention schemes to several datasets.",
          "main_review": "Overall, I think the subject that the manuscript aims to extend is of high current interest. But I think the authors have focused on an overly dry/technical aspect of the problem. The main theoretical contribution seems to be the statement of conditions under which a kernel exponential distribution exists (i.e., the normalization constant is finite).  \nI don't have any technical objections to this development.\nBut an attention mechanism is a means for obtaining improved performance, and I would have expected a clearer demonstration that the theoretical development is worth considering from a practical standpoint (i.e., is computationally light enough to be part of a deep network, and improves performance significantly). \n\nIn that respect, I found the experiments to be thin in terms of demonstrating how and why one should consider the proposed alternative over existing ones.\nInstead of considering three very short experiments, it would be more useful to focus on one experiment with a clear explanation of the computational load, and the steps taken in order to compute the attention vector. \n\nThe improvement obtained by using the proposed mechanism was also not clear to me -- for instance in the IMDB example, the results are close to when the attention mechanism is continuous sparsemax (from previous work). For uWave, the proposed attention mechanism does better than when alternatives are usedm, but the accuracy obtained is around the accuracty reported in the original paper (from 2009, i.e., the pre-deep learning era).\n\nI would suggest the authors to focus more on the experimental section.\nA discussion on computational cost is also welcome. The authors do mention the intention of replacing the (undesired, in my opinion) numerical integration, but even with Monte Carlo techniques, wouldn't this be a bottleneck?",
          "summary_of_the_review": "I think the manuscript considers a subject of high current interest. The contribution is mostly theoretical, laying out conditions under which a pdf from a family exists (which is a fair question to consider). While I don't have any technical objections, the attention mechanism looks computationally costly, and I wonder if this is going to be an issue during training in practice. Also, I found the experimental evaluation weak, and hand-wavy. I would have expected a clear demonstration of how the method is used, what its computational cost is, and how it improves upon existing alternatives.",

          "main_review": "This work is well-motivated and the authors clearly highlighted differences with previous work (section 3).\nMoreover, the contribution is well founded and the authors conducted detailed theoretical analysis of their approach.\n\nHowever, there are computational limits in the proposed method, as highlighted by the authors: the partition function lacks of a closed form expression (end of page 7).\nTherefore, they rely on numerical integration to compute it.\nAlthough this opens up possible research direction for future work, I would like to have more information about experrimental speed efficiency of kernel deformed exponential families  compared to standard sparsemax/softmax.\n\nMoreover, the benefit of the attention mechanism proposed by the authors is that it allows sparsity and multimodality: the paper would benefit of including experimental evidence that this mechanism is important, beside test-set accuracy. What is the actually sparsity ratio compared to sparsemax? How important is the multimodality property? (i.e. are there many instances where the attention map is *really* multimodal?

We will work to incorporate the comments to submit to the next conference. Particularly we will characterize the rate of convergence of numerical integration in our setting both theoretically and empirically, and go more in depth into at least one of the experiments. Reviewer 1/w800, thank you for the suggestion of characterizing how often sparsity and multimodality show up in attention densities. Reviewer 2/wuA4, your point that 'an attention mechanism is a means for obtaining improved performance, and I would have expected a clearer demonstration that the theoretical development is worth considering from a practical standpoint' gives us a helpful way of guiding our future applications. Reviewer 3/eE87, your point that we need to show the advantage of adding kernels will similarly be a guiding point.\n\nBest,\nAuthors"

          "comment": "This paper extends the recent work on continuous-domain sparse attention mechanisms to use kernel parametrizations, and thus allow more flexible multi-modal shapes. Continuous attention extends the standard attention mechanisms to continuous-valued key/value/query functions, involving integrals over probability measures instead of sums over softmax-weighted sums. \n\nKernel methods fit very well in the framework and provide great expressivity. Reviewers agree it is an interesting and well-motivated idea. The contribution of incorporating kernel families in continuous attention seems substantially novel in comparison to the previous work on the topic.\n\nThe main concern, however, is that the paper focuses too much on the theory and not enough on the modeling benefits  enabled by flexible kernels. I would stress that this isn't a question of *improving performance* purely (although quantitative results would help!) but perhaps more of qualitative results, demonstrating e.g. multimodality, selectivity, interpretability.\n\nI very much look forward to a revised version, which I expect would be a strong paper."

In contrast, the kernel exponential family comprises pdfs that have essentially infinitely many sufficient statistics through the use of a kernel. The current manuscript proposes to employ a kernel exponential family, and a deformed kernel exponential family. This allows them to work with multimodal probability distributions, and/or distributions with compact support. The authors layout conditions under which the kernel versions of the (deformed) exponential family are defined. They also apply the new attention schemes to several datasets.",
          "main_review": "Overall, I think the subject that the manuscript aims to extend is of high current interest. But I think the authors have focused on an overly dry/technical aspect of the problem. The main theoretical contribution seems to be the statement of conditions under which a kernel exponential distribution exists (i.e., the normalization constant is finite).  \nI don't have any technical objections to this development.\nBut an attention mechanism is a means for obtaining improved performance, and I would have expected a clearer demonstration that the theoretical development is worth considering from a practical standpoint (i.e., is computationally light enough to be part of a deep network, and improves performance significantly). \n\nIn that respect, I found the experiments to be thin in terms of demonstrating how and why one should consider the proposed alternative over existing ones.\nInstead of considering three very short experiments, it would be more useful to focus on one experiment with a clear explanation of the computational load, and the steps taken in order to compute the attention vector. \n\nThe improvement obtained by using the proposed mechanism was also not clear to me -- for instance in the IMDB example, the results are close to when the attention mechanism is continuous sparsemax (from previous work). For uWave, the proposed attention mechanism does better than when alternatives are usedm, but the accuracy obtained is around the accuracty reported in the original paper (from 2009, i.e., the pre-deep learning era).\n\nI would suggest the authors to focus more on the experimental section.\nA discussion on computational cost is also welcome. The authors do mention the intention of replacing the (undesired, in my opinion) numerical integration, but even with Monte Carlo techniques, wouldn't this be a bottleneck?",
          "summary_of_the_review": "I think the manuscript considers a subject of high current interest. The contribution is mostly theoretical, laying out conditions under which a pdf from a family exists (which is a fair question to consider). While I don't have any technical objections, the attention mechanism looks computationally costly, and I wonder if this is going to be an issue during training in practice. Also, I found the experimental evaluation weak, and hand-wavy. I would have expected a clear demonstration of how the method is used, what its computational cost is, and how it improves upon existing alternatives.",

What is the actually sparsity ratio compared to sparsemax? How important is the multimodality property? (i.e. are there many instances where the attention map is *really* multimodal?

We will work to incorporate the comments to submit to the next conference. Particularly we will characterize the rate of convergence of numerical integration in our setting both theoretically and empirically, and go more in depth into at least one of the experiments. Reviewer 1/w800, thank you for the suggestion of characterizing how often sparsity and multimodality show up in attention densities. Reviewer 2/wuA4, your point that 'an attention mechanism is a means for obtaining improved performance, and I would have expected a clearer demonstration that the theoretical development is worth considering from a practical standpoint' gives us a helpful way of guiding our future applications. Reviewer 3/eE87, your point that we need to show the advantage of adding kernels will similarly be a guiding point.\n\nBest,\nAuthors"

          "comment": "This paper extends the recent work on continuous-domain sparse attention mechanisms to use kernel parametrizations, and thus allow more flexible multi-modal shapes. Continuous attention extends the standard attention mechanisms to continuous-valued key/value/query functions, involving integrals over probability measures instead of sums over softmax-weighted sums. \n\nKernel methods fit very well in the framework and provide great expressivity. Reviewers agree it is an interesting and well-motivated idea. The contribution of incorporating kernel families in continuous attention seems substantially novel in comparison to the previous work on the topic.\n\nThe main concern, however, is that the paper focuses too much on the theory and not enough on the modeling benefits  enabled by flexible kernels. I would stress that this isn't a question of *improving performance* purely (although quantitative results would help!) but perhaps more of qualitative results, demonstrating e.g. multimodality, selectivity, interpretability.\n\nI very much look forward to a revised version, which I expect would be a strong paper."
