    "abstract": "Deep learning motivated by convolutional neural networks has been highly successful in a range of medical imaging problems like image classification, image\nsegmentation, image synthesis etc. However for validation and interpretability, not\nonly do we need the predictions made by the model but also how confident it is\nwhile making those predictions. This is important in safety critical applications\nfor the people to accept it. In this work, we used an encoder decoder architecture\nbased on variational inference techniques for segmenting brain tumour images. We\nevaluate our work on the publicly available BRATS dataset using Dice Similarity\nCoefficient (DSC) and Intersection Over Union (IOU) as the evaluation metrics.\nOur model is able to segment brain tumours while taking into account both aleatoric\nuncertainty and epistemic uncertainty in a principled bayesian manner.",

It uses the U-Net architecture and BRATS18 dataset for evaluation. It quantifies uncertainty with 3 methods and evaluates the predictions with Dice score (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IOU). ",
          "main_review": "Strengths:\n\n-- U-Net architecture as backbone is a strong choice for the medical image segmentation and the proposed method was evaluated on publicly available dataset.\n\n-- The paper provides results of 3 different uncertainty quantification methods (\"MC dropout\", \"Deep Ensembles\", \"Ensemble MC dropout\"), , and DSC/IOU of varying train sizes.\n\n-- The paper includes background of the existing theory and sentences are usually clear.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n-- The novelty of the paper is quite limited. The authors are encouraged to re-evaluate the study from the methodological and/or clinical perspective, and provide clear and specific points about their novel contributions at the end of the introduction. Related work section does not include any information about the existing related studies in the literature (e.g. [1, 2, 3]).\n\n-- The paper could possibly be considered as an application paper but the contributions in the paper have marginally low significance because the paper provides very limited empirical insights with already available methods with slight changes. \n\n-- The organization of the paper should be improved. For example, the majority of the paper contains just definitions of the known formulas. Most equations presented in the paper are missing references. Can the authors clarify whether there are any novel equations in the paper? Also, some methodological details are missing. The authors stated \"Our model uses a similar encoder decoder architecture as that used in VAEs with the input to the encoder coming from a pre trained image segmentation architecture.\". What type of VAE architecture was this? Were there any modifications? With which data was the encoder pre-trained? The authors are encouraged to add these details to the paper. \n\n-- I also highly recommend that the authors compare their methodology with the previous works (e.g. [1]). In its current form, the paper does not provide any comparison with the existing studies in the literature, or a comparison of different backbones even though the authors stated that \"We tried different backbones which have previously enjoyed success and found original U-Net gave the best results.\" in the paper. Can the authors clarify what those backbones are? I assumed these are U-Net, V-Net and FCN as stated in the conclusion (without any references) but the authors are encouraged to list them in the method section (with references to the specific architectures unless they are novel).\n\n\n\n[1] Kwon, Yongchan, Joong-Ho Won, Beom Joon Kim, and Myunghee Cho Paik. \"Uncertainty quantification using Bayesian neural networks in classification: Application to biomedical image segmentation.\" Computational Statistics & Data Analysis 142 (2020): 106816.\n\n[2] Nair, Tanya, Doina Precup, Douglas L.

Therefore, the AC recommends rejection."

          "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a method to quantify uncertainty in medical imaging, which is an important task for clinical applications, with variational inference. It uses the U-Net architecture and BRATS18 dataset for evaluation. It quantifies uncertainty with 3 methods and evaluates the predictions with Dice score (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IOU). ",
          "main_review": "Strengths:\n\n-- U-Net architecture as backbone is a strong choice for the medical image segmentation and the proposed method was evaluated on publicly available dataset.\n\n-- The paper provides results of 3 different uncertainty quantification methods (\"MC dropout\", \"Deep Ensembles\", \"Ensemble MC dropout\"), , and DSC/IOU of varying train sizes.\n\n-- The paper includes background of the existing theory and sentences are usually clear.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n-- The novelty of the paper is quite limited. The authors are encouraged to re-evaluate the study from the methodological and/or clinical perspective, and provide clear and specific points about their novel contributions at the end of the introduction. Related work section does not include any information about the existing related studies in the literature (e.g. [1, 2, 3]).\n\n-- The paper could possibly be considered as an application paper but the contributions in the paper have marginally low significance because the paper provides very limited empirical insights with already available methods with slight changes. \n\n-- The organization of the paper should be improved. For example, the majority of the paper contains just definitions of the known formulas. Most equations presented in the paper are missing references. Can the authors clarify whether there are any novel equations in the paper? Also, some methodological details are missing. The authors stated \"Our model uses a similar encoder decoder architecture as that used in VAEs with the input to the encoder coming from a pre trained image segmentation architecture.\". What type of VAE architecture was this? Were there any modifications? With which data was the encoder pre-trained? The authors are encouraged to add these details to the paper. \n\n-- I also highly recommend that the authors compare their methodology with the previous works (e.g. [1]). In its current form, the paper does not provide any comparison with the existing studies in the literature, or a comparison of different backbones even though the authors stated that \"We tried different backbones which have previously enjoyed success and found original U-Net gave the best results.\" in the paper. Can the authors clarify what those backbones are? I assumed these are U-Net, V-Net and FCN as stated in the conclusion (without any references) but the authors are encouraged to list them in the method section (with references to the specific architectures unless they are novel).\n\n\n\n[1] Kwon, Yongchan, Joong-Ho Won, Beom Joon Kim, and Myunghee Cho Paik. \"Uncertainty quantification using Bayesian neural networks in classification: Application to biomedical image segmentation.\" Computational Statistics & Data Analysis 142 (2020): 106816.\n\n[2] Nair, Tanya, Doina Precup, Douglas L.

The main limitations pointed out by reviewers relate to the limited contributions (either methodological or applicative and clinical), the lack of positioning with respect to related works, the presentation needing improvement and the lack of experimental comparison with respect to recent relevant baselines. \nNo rebuttal was provided. \\\nThe AC carefully read the submission and agrees that the paper is premature for publication in the current form. Therefore, the AC recommends rejection."
