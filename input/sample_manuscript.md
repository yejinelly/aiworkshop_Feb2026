# Seasonal Patterns of Climate Anxiety Among Adolescents: A 2-Year Longitudinal Study

## Abstract

Climate anxiety is increasingly prevalent among young people, yet little is known about its temporal dynamics. This study examined seasonal patterns of climate anxiety in 320 adolescents over 2 years (8 time points). Results showed anxiety peaking in summer and declining in winter. Coastal residence and political news sensitivity moderated these patterns. Notably, death-related climate concerns showed the strongest seasonal variation.

## Introduction

Climate anxiety refers to distress about environmental degradation and climate change, often including existential concerns about mortality and the future. Recent surveys indicate that 60-70% of young people report climate-related worry, with many expressing fears about dying from climate disasters or concerns about whether they should have children.

Seasonal factors may influence climate anxiety through extreme weather events, media coverage of climate issues, and political news cycles. Individual differences in geographic vulnerability (e.g., coastal residence) and political news sensitivity may also shape these patterns.

This study addresses two questions:
1. Does climate anxiety show seasonal variation in adolescents?
2. Do coastal residence and political news sensitivity moderate seasonal patterns?

## Methods

### Participants

We recruited 320 adolescents (M age = 16.2, SD = 1.1; 52% female) from four high schools in Seoul, South Korea. Retention rate was 89% across all 8 waves.

### Measures

**Climate Anxiety Scale (CAS).** 10-item measure with three subscales:
- *Cognitive-emotional* (4 items): general worry about climate change
- *Functional impairment* (3 items): interference with daily life
- *Death-related concerns* (3 items): fears about dying from climate disasters, concerns about human extinction

Sample items: "I feel anxious when I think about climate change"; "I worry that I or people I love will die because of climate change."

**Coastal Residence.** Binary measure of living within 10km of the coastline.

**Political News Sensitivity.** 5-item scale measuring attention and emotional reactivity to political news (α = .84).

### Procedure

Data collection occurred at 8 time points over 2 years:
- Year 1: March (spring), June (summer), September (fall), December (winter)
- Year 2: March (spring), June (summer), September (fall), December (winter)

### Analysis

Multilevel models with season, coastal residence, and political news sensitivity as predictors.

## Results

### Seasonal Effects

Significant seasonal variation was found (χ²(3) = 45.7, p < .001). Compared to winter:
- Summer: b = 0.80, p < .001
- Fall: b = 0.47, p < .001
- Spring: b = 0.23, p = .04

Death-related concerns showed the largest seasonal swing (summer-winter difference: d = 0.65), followed by cognitive-emotional (d = 0.48) and functional impairment (d = 0.31).

### Moderating Effects

**Coastal residence** amplified seasonal variation. Adolescents living near the coast showed larger summer peaks (b = 0.34, p = .008) compared to inland residents.

**Political news sensitivity** also moderated seasonality. High-sensitivity adolescents showed stronger summer increases (b = 0.28, p = .02), particularly during election periods.

## Discussion

Climate anxiety in adolescents follows a predictable seasonal pattern, with death-related concerns showing the most pronounced variation. Coastal residents and politically engaged youth showed amplified seasonal patterns, suggesting that geographic proximity to climate-vulnerable areas may increase vulnerability to seasonal triggers.

**Limitations.** Our sample was limited to urban Korean adolescents. Self-report measures may not capture physiological responses.

**Implications.** Interventions targeting death-related climate concerns may be most needed in summer. Mental health services in coastal communities should be aware that local youth may experience greater seasonal distress due to direct exposure to climate impacts.
